This repo showcases 100 days of CUDA



# Day 1
# File: https://github.com/AhmadullahLaskar/100DayCUDAchallenge-AhmadullahLaskar/blob/main/Day01/VectorAddition.cu
# Summary:
Implemented vector addition by writing a simple CUDA program. Explored how to launch a kernel to perform a parallelized addition of two arrays, where each thread computes the sum of a pair of values.

# What I Learned:

Basics of writing a CUDA kernel.
Understanding of grid, block, and thread hierarchy in CUDA.
How to allocate and manage device (GPU) memory using cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, and cudaFree.

# Reading:
Read Chapter 1 of the PMPP book.
Learned about the fundamentals of parallel programming, CUDA architecture, and the GPU execution model.
